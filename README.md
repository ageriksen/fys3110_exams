The lectures will follow the textbook (Griffiths) rather closely, and a list of chapters lectured upon will be presented on this page before the exams. For a tentative list, see the time schedule page.

List of material treated in lectures and problems:
Griffiths: 2 (not 2.6),3,4,5 (not 5.4),6 (not 6.4.3),7,8 + the notes: Time evolution of states in quantum mechanics, Symmetry and degeneracy + homework problems.

On the final exam you may bring:
Approved calculator, D.J. Griffiths: “Introduction to Quantum Mechanics”, the printed notes: “Time evolution of states in quantum mechanics” and “Symmetry and degeneracy”, one handwritten A4-sheet(2 pages) with your own notes, and K. Rottmann: “Matematisk formelsamling”.
